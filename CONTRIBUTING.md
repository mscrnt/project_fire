## Coding Guidelines

### General Guidelines

* Write clear, idiomatic Go code
* Follow the [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
* Keep functions small and focused
* Write descriptive commit messages
* Add comments for complex logic
* Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external services
* Use table-driven tests where appropriate
* Mock external dependencies
* Aim for >80% code coverage for new code

### Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add godoc comments to all exported functions and types
* Include examples in documentation where helpful
* Update CHANGELOG.md with notable changes

## Adding New Test Plugins

To add a new test plugin:

1. Create a new package in `pkg/plugin/yourtest/`
2. Implement the `TestPlugin` interface
3. Register your plugin in `init()`
4. Add documentation in the plugin file
5. Create unit tests
6. Update the available tests documentation

Example:
```go
package yourtest

import "github.com/mscrnt/project_fire/pkg/plugin"

func init() {
    plugin.Register("yourtest", &YourTestPlugin{})
}

type YourTestPlugin struct{}

func (p *YourTestPlugin) Info() plugin.TestInfo {
    return plugin.TestInfo{
        Name:        "Your Test",
        Description: "Description of what your test does",
        Category:    plugin.CategoryCPU, // or Memory, Storage, etc.
    }
}

// Implement other required methods...
```

## Telemetry and Privacy

When contributing features that collect data:

* Ensure all data collection is anonymous
* Never collect personal information
* Document what data is collected
* Respect the telemetry opt-out flag
* Update TELEMETRY.md if adding new telemetry
